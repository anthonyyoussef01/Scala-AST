# Scala-AST
Question 1 (AST interpretation)

Write an evaluator (called eval) for the following AST, except for Let and Subs. You should fill in "eval" so it goes
from a Calc and turns it into an int.

During your pairing interview, you'll extend this to use the Let and Subs statements. For example: 
Let x equal 3 in y = 3 * x + 4
